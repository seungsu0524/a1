<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong>Lee Seung Su<br>
<strong>Login:</strong>jc323323</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The CossiePlay website is intended to make business more successful and to increase number of people doing a costume play, especially about 35 - 50 years old for them to enjoy costume and socialise with other people.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> Different types of promoting will be constant for 2 month (excluding website) so that customers can check website's attribution to increase in number of players. After every 2 months, number of new customers will be check and compared with previous 2 months. Additionally, the bounce rate (rate of people who left site without clicking further links) can be checked to check how many people are actually interested in the website.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The Cossieplay wants to get player of all ages, but currently, most of the players are young audience. So, Target audience will be older audinece who will be 35-50, who the site is aimed at. I will design the website with unique font and pictures to attract old0er people.</p>
